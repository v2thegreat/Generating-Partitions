# Generating-Partitions

## What is this?

This repo contains a Python script to generate all the __Partitions__ for a given number, which is then saved to a file with the appropriate name for easy use in the future

## What are Partitions?

According to Wikipedia: 
*In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer n, also called an integer partition, is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers. Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.*

It was discovered by an Indian badass who went by the name *Srinivasa Ramanujan.*

And it goes like this:

If I have a number (lets say 5), then, according to the above mentioned badass, if I wanted to get its Parts/Summards are going to be:

`
Partitions(5):
5, 4+1, 2+3
`

## Why?

The concept of partitions has been applied to several areas of science, and looking at it, I decided to create something similar to my own

## Why use Python?

Python is a versatile, easy to use language. But it's slow as hell and partitions can have tremendous amounts of calculations involved and are hence quite RAM hungry while also taking their its sweet time (try to run it for the number 100, and enjoy your wait if you don't believe me :wink: ).

Considering this, I wanted to try to optimize it as much as I could in Python and hence gain a better understanding of Python.

Also, because its Python, so why the hell not?
